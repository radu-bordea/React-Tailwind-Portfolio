            As a student IT developer at Ã…land University of Applied Sciences in
            Finland, my passion lies in coding, and I thoroughly enjoy working
            with technologies such as JavaScript, React, React-Native, Flutter,
            and Node.js. I find immense satisfaction in bringing ideas to life
            through code. Whether it's crafting interactive user interfaces with
            React or building cross-platform mobile applications using
            React-Native and Flutter, I am always eager to explore and apply the
            latest tools in the ever-evolving field of web and mobile
            development. My love for coding extends to server-side development,
            where I leverage the efficiency and scalability of Node.js to create
            robust backend systems. Coding, for me, is not just a skill; it's a
            source of inspiration and a journey of self-discovery in the dynamic
            world of software development.
